Before installing you will need a PayPal account that can support IPN.
Currently this means either a Premium or Business Account.

1. Copy either the entire lm_paypal directory or just
   the *.module, *.install, *.info and *.js files into your drupal/modules
   directory.  For just one site in a multi-site setup copy into
   drupal/sites/www.mysite.com/modules
2. Enable the modules in admin/modules
3. Under administer>settings configure, as appropriate, each module.
4. Under administer>help read the help pages for each module.
