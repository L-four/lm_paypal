==================================
* Set the cancel url to the 'cancel_return' field, not the 'return' field. [#872456].

6.x-2.x-dev - Status at 2009-02-18
==================================

* Did *A LOT* of cleaning in subscriptions module.
* Fixed some wrong tests in paid_adverts module.
* Still working on general cleaning (subscriptions and base module).
* Make use of job_queue module for mail sending, if present.
* Wrote some hook_requirements().

Any changes will be for 2009-02-19 because drupal.org is currently offline for
schedule maintenance (and comit won't work).

6.x-2.x-dev - Status at 2009-02-17
==================================

* Current status (below is changelog):
    - We need to finish lm_paypal module properly. This includes providing full
      paypal usage API, custom and general paypal form generation, provide full
      configuration, clean older methods, and split module with theme functions
      and better Drupal hooks usage.
    - Subscriptions handling module is really ugly, old, and still full of bugs,
      we need to (eventually fully) rewrite it.
    - Paid adverts module is OK, but hook_nodeapi() is still ugly.
    - Donation should just work, but needs review.

* Outdated file. Changelog must be made with CVS changelog review.
  Too much old code has been moved/removed/clean/rewriten.

* Test files have been renamed. Sorry lyrincs, I just can't stand too long
  names. And a lot of other modules just do it also, so why not.

* Some modules test files have been splitted in many test classes. It more
  revealant, we can just process unit-testing for a single part for debug, in
  case only this only one fails.

* Partial rewrite of lm_paypal_subscriptions module
    - Full usage of new process ipn hooks provided by lm_paypal
    - Module file splited in admin.inc, pages.inc, .theme files
    - Rewrote all hook_menu() part, make high usage of access callbacks
    - Some code cleanup
  Important notes: module is still really unstable, do not, never use any
  non unit-tested function from that module until stable releases.

* Almost full rewrite of lm_paypal_paid_adverts module
    - Now use in a cleaner way hook_nodeapi() and hook_link()
    - Provide some simple API functions for other modules
    - Did some static cache to improve performances
    - Did some ergonomic tricks that look and feel really nicier
    - Make high usage of hook_menu() and access callbacks
    - Really high unit-test coverage
  Code is still ugly. Rewriting body and title in content in nodeapi is
  something which is really ugly, and that can't override any other module
  behavior.
  New way of hiding content is still in brain storming.

* lm_paypal_donation don't seems to past tests anymore. Module needs review.

* lm_paypal low level module has been highly rewriten, and now provide a nicier
  API and some (sadly undocumented) usable hooks to use paypal.

6.x-2.x-dev - Status before 2009
================================

* WIP add simpletest for LM Paypal

* split lm_paypal.module into admin and ipn include files to reduce the amount
  of code being loaded on every page request.

* update IPN table definition to match format coming from the IPN simulator

* WIP change admin settings to tabs, rather than nested menus

* remove lots of dynamic SQL generation in favor of drupal_write_record()

* remove custom HTTP code in favor of drupal_http_request()

* WIP remove grotty packing of UID into 16 bits in IPN->custom
